# ImgProc-Fourier-Transform-and-Convolution

This is the second excercise of the Image Proccessing course, we learned about the implimentation of DFT, 2D DFT, Spectograms, rate change methods, and derivatives.

Functionalities:
- 1D DFT transform.
- 2D DFT transfrom.
- Rate change using: 
  - Fourier
  - Spectogram
  - Spectogram and phase vocoder 
- Image derivatives in image space and in the fourier space.
